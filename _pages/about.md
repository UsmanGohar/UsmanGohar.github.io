Hi! I am a Ph.D. student in [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.iastate.edu/) at [Iowa State University (ISU)](https://www.iastate.edu/). I received my M.Sc in Computer Science from the [University of Minneosta](https://www.d.umn.edu/) and my B.Eng. degree from National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST). My research interests are broadly at the intersection of software engineering and machine learning, with a particular focus on Fairness in AI, social computing, and AI for social good. 

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
