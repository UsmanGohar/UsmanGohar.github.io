Hi! I am a Ph.D. student in [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.iastate.edu/) at [Iowa State University (ISU)](https://www.iastate.edu/). I received my M.Sc in Computer Science from the [University of Minnesota](https://www.d.umn.edu/) and my B.Eng. degree from National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST). My research interests are broadly at the intersection of software engineering and machine learning, with a particular focus on Fairness in AI, social computing, and AI for social good. 

My industrial experience includes working as a Data Scientist in fields ranging from agriculture, manufacturing and power systems with specific experience in forecasting, predictive analytics and model deployment.

Under Construction!
